# DS_model

This is a spotify song suggester used in my 4th build week at lambda school.

To use the song suggester download the .ipynb into colab or jupyter notebook.
Run all and follow the prompts

The model uses the spotify kaggle dataset and uses the nearest neighbor model to suggest similar songs to an input.

Thanks for checking out my project!
